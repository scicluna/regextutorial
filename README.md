# Regex Tutorial Starter Code
GIVEN a regex tutorial
WHEN I open the tutorial
THEN I see a descriptive title and introductory paragraph explaining the purpose of the tutorial, a summary describing the regex featured in the tutorial, a table of contents linking to different sections that break down each component of the regex and explain what it does, and a section about the author with a link to the author’s GitHub profile

WHEN I click on the links in the table of contents
THEN I am taken to the corresponding sections of the tutorial

WHEN I read through each section of the tutorial
THEN I find a detailed explanation of what a specific component of the regex does

WHEN I reach the end of the tutorial
THEN I find a section about the author and a link to the author’s GitHub profile

You can choose one of the following regular expressions or you can choose one that you found on your own (with the exception of the one that is covered in the Regex Tutorial: Matching a UsernameLinks to an external site.:

Matching a Hex Value – /^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/

Matching an Email – /^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/

Matching a URL – /^(https?:\/\/)?([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})([\/\w \.-]*)*\/?$/

Matching an HTML Tag – /^<([a-z]+)([^<]+)*(?:>(.*)<\/\1>|\s+\/>)$/

Instead of creating a repository, you’ll publish a GitHub gist. GitHub describes a gist as a simple way to share code snippets with others. It’s also an ideal way to demonstrate a technique, teach a principle, or show off a solution. It functions just like a repository, and you’ll use Markdown to create it, just as you do with your READMEs. Gists can include code, images, links, and anything else you can include in a README.

After you’ve cloned the starter code, learn how to create a gistLinks to an external site.. You can also watch this video on how to use gistsLinks to an external site..

IMPORTANT
Make revisions to your gist in the GitHub gist UI. This will create a revision history that graders can use to verify that the tutorial content is yours.

NOTE
The regular expression that you choose may not include all of the components outlined in the starter code. After you’ve finished your tutorial, you can remove any sections that you didn’t use.

Each section that describes a component should include more than just one sentence explaining what it does. It should also include a code snippet of that particular component and some examples that meet the requirements of that component.
